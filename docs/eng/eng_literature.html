On December 8th, 1915, Meggie Cleary had her fourth birthday.
After the breakfast dishes were put away her mother silently thrust a
brown paper parcel into her arms and ordered her outside. So
Meggie squatted down behind the gorse bush next to the front gate
and tugged impatiently. Her fingers were clumsy, the wrapping
heavy; it smelled faintly of the Wahine general store, which told her
that whatever lay inside the parcel had miraculously been bought,
not homemade or donated. Something fine and mistily gold began
to poke through a corner; she attacked the paper faster, peeling it
away in long, ragged strips. "Agnes! Oh, Agnes!" she said lovingly,
blinking at the doll lying there in a tattered nest. A miracle indeed.
Only once in her life had Meggie been into Wahine; all the way
back in May, because she had been a very good girl. So perched in
the buggy beside her mother, on her best behavior, she had been too
excited to see or remember much. Except for Agnes, the beautiful
doll sitting on the store counter, dressed in a crinoline of pink satin
with cream lace frills all over it. Right then and there in her mind
she had christened it Agnes, the only name she knew elegant
enough for such a peerless creature. Yet over the ensuing months
her yearning after Agnes contained nothing of hope; Meggie didn't
own a doll and had no idea little girls and dolls belonged together.
She played happily with the whistles and slingshots and battered
soldiers her brothers discarded, got her hands dirty and her boots
muddy. It never occurred to her that Agnes was to play with.
Stroking the bright pink folds of the dress, grander than any she had
ever seen on a human woman, she picked Agnes up tenderly. The
doll had jointed arms and legs which could be moved anywhere;
even her neck and tiny, shapely waist were jointed. Her golden hair
was exquisitely dressed in a high pompadour studded with pearls,
her pale bosom peeped out of a foaming fichu of cream lace
fastened with a pearl pin. The finely painted bone china face was
beautiful, left unglazed to give the delicately tinted skin a natural
matte texture. Astonishingly lifelike blue eyes shone between lashes
of real hair, their irises streaked and circled with a darker blue;
fascinated, Meggie discovered that when Agnes lay back far
enough, her eyes closed. High on one faintly flushed cheek she had
a black beauty mark, and her dusky mouth was parted slightly to
show tiny white teeth. Meggie put the doll gently on her lap,
crossed her feet under her comfortably, and sat just looking. She
was still sitting behind the gorse bush when Jack and Hughie came
rustling through the grass where it was too close to the fence to feel
a scythe. Her hair was the typical Cleary beacon, all the Cleary
children save Frank being martyred by a thatch some shade of red;
Jack nudged his brother and pointed gleefully. They separated,
grinning at each other, and pretended they were troopers after a
Maori renegade. Meggie would not have heard them anyway, so
engrossed was she in Agnes, humming softly to herself. "What's
that you've got, Meggie?" Jack shouted, pouncing. "Show us!"
"Yes, show us!" Hughie giggled, outflanking her.
She clasped the doll against her chest and shook her head. "No,
she's mine! I got her for my birthday!"
"Show us, go on! We just want to have a look."
Pride and joy won out. She held the doll so her brothers could see.
"Look, isn't she beautiful? Her name is Agnes."
"Agnes? Agnes?" Jack gagged realistically. "What a soppy name!
Why don't you call her Margaret or Betty?"
"Because she's Agnes!"
Hughie noticed the joint in the doll's wrist, and whistled. "Hey,
Jack, look! It can move its hand!"
"Where? Let's see."
"No!" Meggie hugged the doll close again, tears forming. "No,
you'll break her! Oh, Jack, don't take her away-you'll break her!"
"Pooh!" His dirty brown hands locked about her wrists, closing
tightly. "Want a Chinese burn? And don't be such a crybaby, or I'll
tell Bob." He squeezed her skin in opposite directions until it
stretched whitely, as Hughie got hold of the doll's skirts and pulled.
"Gimme, or I'll do it really hard!"
"No! Don't, Jack, please don't! You'll break her, I know you will!
Oh, please leave her alone! Don't take her, please!" In spite of the
cruel grip on her wrists she clung to the doll, sobbing and kicking.
"Got it" Hughie whooped, as the doll slid under Meggie's crossed
forearms. Jack and Hughie found her just as fascinating as Meggie
had; off came the dress, the petticoats and long, frilly drawers.
Agnes lay naked while the boys pushed and pulled at her, forcing
one foot round the back of her head, making her look down her
spine, every possible contortion they could think of. They took no
notice of Meggie as she stood crying; it did not occur to her to seek
help, for in the Cleary family those who could not fight their own
battles got scant aid or sympathy, and that went for girls, too.
The doll's golden hair tumbled down, the pearls flew winking into
the long grass and disappeared. A dusty boot came down
thoughtlessly on the abandoned dress, smearing grease from the
smithy across its satin. Meggie dropped to her knees, scrabbling
frantically to collect the miniature clothes before more damage was
done them, then she began picking among the grass blades where
she thought the pearls might have fallen. Her tears were blinding
her, the grief in her heart new, for until now she had never owned
anything worth grieving for.
Frank threw the shoe hissing into cold water and straightened his
back; it didn't ache these days, so perhaps he was used to smithying.
Not before time, his father would have said, after six months at it.
But Frank knew very well how long it was since his introduction to
the forge and anvil; he had measured the time in hatred and
resentment. Throwing the hammer into its box, he pushed the lank
black hair off his brow with a trembling hand and dragged the old
leather apron from around his neck. His shirt lay on a heap of straw
in the corner; he plodded across to it and stood for a moment staring
at the splintering barn wall as if it did not exist, his black eyes wide
and fixed. He was very small, not above five feet three inches, and
thin still as striplings are, but the bare shoulders and arms had
muscles already knotted from working with the hammer, and the
pale, flawless skin gleamed with sweat. The darkness of his hair and
eyes had a foreign tang, his full-lipped mouth and wide-bridged
nose not the usual family shape, but there was Maori blood on his
mother's side and in him it showed. He was nearly sixteen years old,
where Bob was barely eleven, Jack ten, Hughie nine, Stuart five and
little Meggie three. Then he remembered that today Meggie was
four; it was December 8th. He put on his shirt and left the barn.
The house lay on top of a small hill about one hundred feet higher
than the barn and stables.
